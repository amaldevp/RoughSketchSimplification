How to run: 

The code requires OpenCV and CGAL. 
Do "cmake .", "make" and then run using "Multi filename". 
After tuning the parameters, right-click on that window itself to go to next window. 
Finally, if you right-click on the "Smooth" window, SVG will be created and saved as an html file with the same name as the input file.
Also check the Youtube video to see a demo.

Use of parameters:

1. Growing Parameter:- Merges adjacent strokes
2. Masking Regions:- If some unwanted small parts appears in between strokes, this will help us to mask them. It gives the number of closed regions after filling procedure, initially 0 means there are no closed regions, you have to change it appropriately to get result.
3. Skeleton Pruning:- To remove unnecessary branches from the skeleton.
4. Smooth:- How smooth the result should be. High value means less smooth.

Make sure you adjust the bar atleast once before you RIGHT-CLICK on the window.
