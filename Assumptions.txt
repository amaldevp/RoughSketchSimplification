This is a new reimplementation of the code. It has few assumptions and minor changes from the original version (of the one submitted to the journal).

1. I didn't include the sharp corner restoration part (though it is mentioned in the paper and was in our initial prototype) since it is not that strong and efficient.

2. I used constant background intensity ( a pixel is considered as a point only if its intensity is lesser than 200 - since we had made an assumption that the input is binary - that can be directly changed in the program if you feel required).

3. Also, I resized the image height/width to 700 (since I have a small screen in my new place), you can alter it to generate better results as well (since resizing affects point location).

4. Tha algorithm terribly fails if there is some shading information in the image.

5. The code might have some bugs as well ;-)
